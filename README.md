# Poetic_Language

This is my graduation project，something about NLP and front-end. As the repository name, this project try to analyze the feelings behind the poem, based on The Whole Tang Poetry. 

## Forward-looking work

At first, I do a samll experimental work with some skills maybe used in later. This work, which is originated from an accidental inspiration, randomly grabbed a song list from WangYi Music, analyzing the lyrics of all songs from the list to get hidden information. Then, to visualize the result，I make a word-cloud picture using Pypackge--wordcloud.

skills:
 1. jieba is a tool for word segmentation. 
 2. wordcloud to visualize the result.
 
It's first but a good attempt for me. If I want to do simple project I can finish now, because maybe it's enough; but if more challange I want, I must try more difficult thing.
